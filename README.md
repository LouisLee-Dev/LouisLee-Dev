# üëã Welcome to my github profile!
I'm a passionate and collaborative Full Stack Web & Blockchain Engineer with over 8 years of professional experience. I thrive in dynamic, deadline-driven environments and constantly seek innovative solutions to complex problems.
I love working through all the stages of development and I place a lot of importance on DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself), well-documented, and easy to-maintain and scalable code. Communication with the client is a crucial part of web development and I make it a priority to be responsive as well as report regularly on the development process.
